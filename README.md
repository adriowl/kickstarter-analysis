# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
Excel analysis on kickstarter campaign data, mainly focused on theaters and musicals in the US and UK.

# Overview of Project
  The purpose of this analysis was to discover the affect of two variables: goals and launch dates, on the success of Kickstarter funding goals - specifically on Kickstarters where the subcategory was plays. The data was a sample of various Kickstarter campaigns. The aim of this analysis is to get Louise to have many more successful theater play campaigns. 

# Analysis and Challenges
  This analysis was not quite a breeze, but a good refresher course for me, as I had taken Excel classes in undergrad. Although I may have the base knowledge, I did run into challenges like not remembering the exact syntax of some functions like the COUNTIFS that were used for the Outcomes Based On Goals table. I also realized that my graph didn't look like yours, and realized I had left the "equal" sign out of my "less than or equal to" criterias! Small detailed things like that are tough to find but can really mess up your results, so it's important to have a sharp eye. I also had to google how to change the words on the legend, and was quite annoyed when I figured out you can't just type them in like on Word. There has to be an easier way, and I look forward to finding that out. 

# Results
  Two conclusions I can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date are: First, there is a huge spike in successful Theater Kickstarters in the summer. In May is the best time to create your Kickstarter, with June being the second best. Secondly, in our data there are more successful outcomes than failed outcomes for our theater filtered data. This is great news, as it shows that our kickstarter is more likely to be successful than failed.

  I also have two findings based on the Outcomes based on Goals chart. Firstly, the sweet spot for successful play campaigns seems to be around $35000 to $44999. Secondly, the chance of a failed campaign rises exponentially once the goal passes the $45000 mark. Thus for higher chances of a successful campaign for the Plays subcategory the goal should be set somewhere in that range of $35000 to $44999.

  Some limitations of this dataset are that it is not representative of an entire population, just those who are on Kickstarter. There could be other data on other crowdfunding websites like GoFundMe, or maybe even fundraising efforts that take place in the real world, where we won't be able to get any data from. Either way it would be a difficult task to get a perfect representation of the population of fundraising campaigns for theaters and plays.
  
  There are many possible combinations of this data that could yield useful results. For example: Are Staff Picks or Spotlights more likely to be successful? Or, looking at the range between Date Created Conversion and Date Ended Conversion, how long does it take successful campaigns to get to their goal, on average? Additionally, we filtered on Plays subcategory, but there is much more than simply Plays. What if we looked at other subcategories in the Theater category? Would they have similar results to our analysis? These are just a couple ideas on how to get started doing some deeper analysis.
